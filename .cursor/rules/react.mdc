React Naming Conventions:

- Use kebab-case for files and directories.

Components:
- DO not use 'use client' or 'use server' statements
- Favor named exports for components
- Ensure components are modular, reusable, and maintain a clear separation of concerns.
- Always split React components out so there is only ever one per file
- Keep logic as low as possible.

UI and Styling:

- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach
